### Overview

This is the reference environment for the manuscript ['Network deconvolution as a general method to distinguish direct dependencies in networks'](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2635).  It executes code to reproduce specific results described in the manuscript.   You can find more information about this research at the [project page here](http://compbio.mit.edu/nd/).

### Instructions for use

This version of the reference environment is a virtual machine managed by [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).  To use it, install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/feizi2013network.git
$ cd feizi2013network
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant reload
```
This will start a virtual machine with scripts to run which reproduce results described in the manuscript.
